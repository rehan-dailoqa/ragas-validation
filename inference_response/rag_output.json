The acquisition of The Co-operative Bank has meant an extensive review of governance structures and arrangements. This is summarised on page 12 of this Annual Report. Board priorities for the year ahead In the coming year, we are anticipating further easing in the interest rate environment and believe this will support an increase in housing market activity. We will continue to work hard to balance the needs of our mortgage and savings members, and ensure we meet their expectations in terms of service and value. Having completed the acquisition of The Co-operative Bank in January 2025, we have begun the work to integrate the two organisations and deliver the benefits I have outlined.

Our priority is always to balance the interests of our savers and borrowers, while maintaining the Society's financial strength for the good of all members, current and future. The ability to plan for the long-term success of the Society has been at the heart of our transformational acquisition of The Co-operative Bank. Members' interests were central to this acquisition, which we completed on 1 January 2025. As we celebrate our 140th anniversary, we believe that this groundbreaking combination of ethical and purpose- led organisations is an opportunity to build, and future- proof, a bigger and better mutual building society for the benefit of all stakeholders. Steve, our Chief Executive, will talk more in his review about the rationale and implications of the acquisition and the integration plans that lie ahead. However, in listening to our members, it is clear that while they see the potential benefits of the acquisition, their immediate priority is that we maintain the strength of the Society's existing proposition, and particularly the outstanding service, value and security that they receive today. The Board and the Society's executive team are committed to meeting this expectation, and we believe that the Society's performance this year shows that this focus has been unaffected by the additional work required to make the acquisition a reality.

The year in which we celebrated our 140th anniversary was also the year we laid the foundations of a larger, more diversified and impactful business through the acquisition of The Co-operative Bank ('the Bank'). What links the two organisations is the clarity that mutuality provides in prioritising the long-term needs and interests of members. We have shown this in 2024, not simply by pursuing the transformational combination of the Society and the Bank, but by delivering value, service, security and the positive wider social impact that our members expect every day. In doing so, we have achieved a strong and sustainable financial and business performance that sets the combined organisation up for continued success in the future. During 2024, we grew savings and mortgages balances, increased the savings member premium once again to record levels, and delivered an outstanding service experience across our customer-facing channels. We also made considerable progress with our investment priorities, adding choice and convenience to members' interactions with us, and building efficiency and resilience into our operations and infrastructure. We delivered this during a year in which the external environment continued to confound commentators and industry forecasts alike. At the start of 2024, it was widely predicted that inflation would fall quickly within the Bank of England's target range, and that base rate could be cut as many as five times during the course of the year. Instead, continued geopolitical uncertainty, including elections in the UK and US, together with persistent inflation in the service sector and wages generally, meant that base rate was cut just twice, ending the year at 4.75%. The UK economy performed sluggishly during the year, and whilst it is understandable that the new",
