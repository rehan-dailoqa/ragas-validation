Therefore, it could not provide a specific number or any facts regarding the duration of operation.\n\n#### Vector Search Answer\n- The Vector Search method states that Coventry Building Society has been in operation for **140 years**, celebrating this anniversary in 2024.\n\n#### Keyword Search Answer\n- The Keyword Search method also confirms that Coventry Building Society has been in operation for **140 years** according to the 2024 report.\n\n### Additional Context from the Report\n- **Milestone Year**: 2024 is significant as it marks the **140th anniversary** of the Society.\n- **Acquisition**: The report mentions the transformational acquisition of The Co-operative Bank, completed on **1 January 2025**.\n- **Financial Metrics**:\n  - **Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio**: **28.0%**\n  - **UK Leverage Ratio**: **5.7%**\n- **Strategic Focus**: The Society aims to balance the interests of savers and borrowers while ensuring financial strength and stability.\n\n### Limitations\n- The Graph QA method did not provide any data, leading to a lack of information regarding the operational history of Coventry Building Society.

The year in which we celebrated our 140th anniversary was also the year we laid the foundations of a larger, more diversified and impactful business through the acquisition of The Co-operative Bank ('the Bank'). What links the two organisations is the clarity that mutuality provides in prioritising the long-term needs and interests of members. We have shown this in 2024, not simply by pursuing the transformational combination of the Society and the Bank, but by delivering value, service, security and the positive wider social impact that our members expect every day. In doing so, we have achieved a strong and sustainable financial and business performance that sets the combined organisation up for continued success in the future. During 2024, we grew savings and mortgages balances, increased the savings member premium once again to record levels, and delivered an outstanding service experience across our customer-facing channels. We also made considerable progress with our investment priorities, adding choice and convenience to members' interactions with us, and building efficiency and resilience into our operations and infrastructure. We delivered this during a year in which the external environment continued to confound commentators and industry forecasts alike. At the start of 2024, it was widely predicted that inflation would fall quickly within the Bank of England's target range, and that base rate could be cut as many as five times during the course of the year. Instead, continued geopolitical uncertainty, including elections in the UK and US, together with persistent inflation in the service sector and wages generally, meant that base rate was cut just twice, ending the year at 4.75%.
